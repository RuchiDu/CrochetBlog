        <h3>
            A star system is a group of planets, meteors, or other objects that orbit a large star.
            While there are many star systems, including at least 200 billion other stars in our galaxy, there is only
            one <u>solar system.</u><br>
            That's because our sun is known by its Latin name, Sol.
            The solar system includes everything that is gravitationally drawn into the sun's orbit.<br>
            Astronomers have discovered there are many other large stars within our galaxy, the Milky Way.
            The solar system has eight planets: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. <br>There
            are <a href="https://www.iau.org/public/themes/pluto/">five officially recognized dwarf planets </a> in our
            solar system: Ceres, Pluto, Haumea, Makemake, and Eris.. It formed 4,500 million years ago. It is on an
            outer spiral arm of the Milky Way galaxy.

    <h3>For millennia, astronomers have followed points of light that seemed to move among the stars. 
        <br>The ancient Greeks named them planets, meaning "wanderers."<br> Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn were known in antiquity, and the invention of the telescope added the Asteroid Belt, Uranus, Neptune, Pluto and many of these worlds' moons. 
        <br>The dawn of the space age saw dozens of probes launched to explore our system, an adventure that continues today. There have been five human-made objects so far, Voyager 1, Voyager 2, New Horizons, Pioneer 10 and Pioneer 11, that have crossed the threshold into interstellar space. </h3>

        <h1><u><i>The Sun</i></u></h1>

        <h3>
            The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a massive, hot ball of plasma, inflated and
            heated by energy produced by nuclear fusion reactions at its core.<br>
            Part of this energy is emitted from its surface as visible light,ultraviolest, and infrared radiation,
            providing most of the energy for life on Earth.<br>
            The Sun has been an object of veneration in many cultures. It has been a central subject for astronomical
            research since antiquity.<br>
            The sun is by far the largest object in our solar system, containing 99.8% of the solar system's mass.<br> It
            sheds most of the heat and light that makes life possible on Earth and possibly elsewhere. <br>Planets orbit the
            sun in oval-shaped paths called ellipses, with the sun slightly off-center of each ellipse.<br>
            NASA has a fleet of spacecraft observing the sun, such as the Parker Solar Probe, to learn more about its
            composition, and to make better predictions about space weather and its effect on Earth.

            Substantial scientific evidence suggests that Mars at one point billions of years ago was a much warmer, wetter world, rivers and maybe even oceans existed.<br> Although Mars' atmosphere is too thin for liquid water to exist on the surface for any length of time, remnants of that wetter Mars still exist today. <br>Sheets of water ice the size of California lie beneath Mars' surface, and at both poles are ice caps made in part of frozen water.<br>
            Scientists also think ancient Mars would have had the conditions to support life like bacteria and other microbes. Hope that signs of this past life — and the possibility of even current lifeforms — may exist on the Red Planet has driven numerous Mars missions and the Red Planet is now one of the most explored planets in the solar system.<br>

            Astronomers believe an object twice the size of Earth collided with Uranus roughly 4 billion years ago, causing Uranus to tilt. That tilt causes extreme seasons that last 20-plus years, and the sun beats down on one pole or the other for 84 Earth-years at a time.<br>
            The collision is also thought to have knocked rock and ice into Uranus' orbit. These later became some of the planet's 27 moons. Methane in Uranus' atmosphere gives the planet its blue-green tint. It also has 13 sets of faint rings.<br>
